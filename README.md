## Introduction
nemesis is an ongoing image to sound synthesis research project by Vansh Murad Kalia.

nemesis has it's roots based in my project for Ben Holtzman's Data Sonification class but it has evolved since then. If you're interested in using a sister project of this research that converts any given image into a Midi file, visit: [Website Coming Soon]

## Next Steps

1. Convert the activations path into an explainer animation video (ongoing Dec 2023)
2. Hypertune sinewave and other parameters guiding our synthesized sound to make them more musiccy (ongoing Dec 2023
